# Heart Shape Drawing using Python Turtle

This is a fun and simple Python script that draws a heart shape using the Turtle graphics module.

## 💡 Overview

The program uses mathematical equations based on parametric functions to create a heart shape. It utilizes the `turtle` module to render the shape on a black canvas with a bright pink color.

## 🖥️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard library only (uses `math` and `turtle`)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Save the script as `heart.py`.
3. Run it using the terminal or an IDE like PyCharm:

### The heart shape is created using the following parametric equations:

x = 15 * sin(k)³
y = 12 * cos(k) - 5 * cos(2k) - 2 * cos(3k) - cos(4k)
